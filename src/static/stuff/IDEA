# Idea

All clients pre-load video ready to roll

All clients open socket to server and indicate they are ready to rumble

Server runs some quick test messages to measure latency.

Server sends the "go" message to all clients, possibly delaying to account for latency (or indicate the time for the client to pause instead; either way works)

If a client stops, it send message to server; server immediately send message to another clients to stop.

Clients reply with where they are paused

When restarting, adjust the start messages to account for both latency and the fact some clients are paused fractionally later.
